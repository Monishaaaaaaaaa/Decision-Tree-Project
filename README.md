# Decision Tree Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements a Decision Tree classifier to predict the target variable using supervised machine learning techniques. The objective is to understand decision boundaries and model interpretability using tree-based algorithms.

## Dataset
A structured dataset containing multiple input features and a labeled target variable.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Train-test split
- Model training using Decision Tree
- Model evaluation using standard classification metrics

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
